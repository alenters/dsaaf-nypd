# NYPD Shooting Incident Data Report
## Setup

1. Download [nypd_shooting_report_alenters.Rmd](nypd_shooting_report_alenters.Rmd).
2. Open file in RStudio.
3. Optionally, make sure necessary libraries are installed by running `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "broom", "knitr", "modelr"))`.

## Knitting

Knitting to either HTML or PDF should work. I suggest knitting to HTML, for simplicity. 

1. With the Rmd file from step 1 open in RStudio, select `Knit` > `Knit to HTML`.
2. Knitted file should either pop up in the Viewer or in an external window, depending on your system and settings.
